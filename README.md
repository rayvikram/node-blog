# node-blog
# has a Procfile so that you can upload it to heroku easily.

As you can see this is a simple and basic blog that i have made as a assignment during my Web-Dev course in Udemy. 
I have used HTML CSS with NodeJS MongoDB to complete this project. I have used various NPM packages like EJS for templating, 
ExpressJS for server , Mongoose for simplifying MongoDB , body-parser, etc.
